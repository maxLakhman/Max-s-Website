  <h1> Hello! I'm Max, welcome to my portfolio</h1>
  <p>I'm a computer science student following my dreams with front and back-end experience. Some of my accomplishments are creating a quiz application in python to help me study for univerisity, working with
     databases by implementing a "hash join" in coursework, and collaborating with other students to create the videogame "Breakout" in assembly language. Some of my favorite classes have been Data Structures, Algorithms and Complexity, and Systems Programming.
