    <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
    <p> Python Quiz Application: Implemented a python quiz application to help me study for my coursework. Ultimately the point of this project, aside from helping me study, was to help me gain experience organizing and refactoring code, while maintaining my programming capabilities between university sessions. </p>
    <p> Personal Website: Designed and implemented a website in HTML and CSS to give me experience working with front-end development. </p>
